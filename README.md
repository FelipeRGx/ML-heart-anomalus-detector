# ML HEART ANOMALUS DETECTOR 
Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

The importance of preventing heart disease has never been more critical. By leveraging data-driven approaches, we can significantly enhance both research efforts and preventive measures, helping more people lead healthier lives. Machine Learning plays a vital role in this, offering precise and reliable predictions for heart disease.

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of heart disease patients, applying data preprocessing techniques, and training several machine learning models to make accurate predictions. The models used include algorithms like KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression. This notebook and dataset are part of my Kaggle kernel titled 'Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras'.

A variety of machine learning techniques were utilized in Python to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease. This is a binary classification task, where the input features consist of several health parameters, and the goal is to predict whether heart disease is present (binary outcome).

Algorithms Implemented:
Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
Support Vector Machine (Scikit-learn)
K-Nearest Neighbors (Scikit-learn)
Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
Artificial Neural Network with one hidden layer (Keras)
The highest accuracy achieved in this project is 95% using the Random Forest algorithm.

Dataset: Heart Disease UCI dataset
